Potential rng() bug.  Static variable in inline function rng() will probably be allocated once per translation unit, instead of once per program.  This will likely result in difficult to debug non-uniformity of random numbers.

Implement linear algebra routines needed for mv gaussian (cholesky, inversion)

mh_step:
    * no_change feature is missing
    * no temperature feature

Add Concept enforcement:
    1. BaseModel (copy_constructible)
    2. VectorModel (operator[], size)
    3. VectorAdapter (set, get, size)

Code cleanliness:
    80 columns max.
    code reviews


Coding standard:
    parameter-lists line-breaks:
        - open paren position (end of line or begin of next?)



Creat deimesnion_mismatch exception
magntidue_squared

---------
Hmc_step

is returning name and temperature by-reference really how we want them to be set?

Looks like you started using boost static assert , but then commented it out.  is this worth persuing further?  Mgiht be a nice feature if it's do-able.  But I've never seen another library do it, so maybe there's a technological barrier to this.
